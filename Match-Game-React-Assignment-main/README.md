<summary>Functionality to be added</summary>
<br/>

The app must have the following functionalities

- Initially,
  - Score should be `0` and time should be `60` sec
  - The image to be matched should have the src attribute value as the value of the key `imageUrl` from the first object in **imagesList** provided
  - The **Fruits** tab should be active and the thumbnails with **FRUIT** as their category should be displayed
- The timer should start running backwards from the `60` sec
- When a tab is clicked, then the thumbnails in the corresponding category should be displayed
- When a thumbnail is clicked, if that is matched with the image to be matched,
  - Score is incremented by one
  - The new image to be matched should be generated randomly among the value of the key `imageUrl` from **imagesList** provided
- When a thumbnail is clicked, if it is not matched with the image to be matched,
  - The game should end, and the [Scorecard](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/match-game-score-card-lg-output.png) view should be displayed
  - When **PLAY AGAIN** button is clicked, then we should be able to play the game again
    - The score and time values should be reset to `0` and `60` sec respectively
    - The image to be matched should reset to the value of the key `imageUrl` from the first object in **imagesList** provided
    - The active tab should reset to **Fruits**, and the thumbnails with **FRUIT** as their category should be displayed
- When the timer reached `0` sec, then the game should end, and the [Scorecard](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/match-game-score-card-lg-output.png) view should be displayed
- The App is provided with `tabsList`. It consists of a list of tabItem objects with the following properties in each tabItem object

  |     Key     | Data Type |
  | :---------: | :-------: |
  |    tabId    |  String   |
  | displayText |  String   |

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
